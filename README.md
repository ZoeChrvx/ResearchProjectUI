# **Introduction :**
For my research project, I decided to re-explore UI and how to use it in a new way that could free us from some of the constraints imposed by UI tools. 
My first choice of exploration was to use the various UI tools in different ways as gameplay elements in their own right, or for something other than simply display and information.

<ins>UI tools as gameplay elements:</>
Using UI tools like sliders or buttons as full-fledged gameplay elements has, unfortunately for me, already been done.
And many times over, as in OSU or simply card games like Hearstone.

Or like “There is no game”. A game that pushes UI as a gameplay even further. 
By playing with the details of the “scenery” or by breaking the 4th wall (but this is more a matter of design).

# **Approach :**
I really wanted to find something special in ui that would surely help other people with a passion for ui. 
Since it's a part of game programming that's often overlooked, the basic engine tools are pretty basic and woefully under-resourced. 
I find myself blocked in my projects because of silly constraints. 
Most of the solutions to these problems are plugins (paid for) or on versions that I unfortunately don't have on hand (school/company choice). 


# **Analysis :**
As I said above, I had a hard time not getting discouraged by this topic given the tons of stuff already done on the ui.
Then I found it. Hardly anyone has tried to make a game menu like a real game. 
That is to say: 3D buttons, a 3D cursor that can be controlled like any other game character. 
And that all the interface is in the 3D world, not on a canva on top of the game.
